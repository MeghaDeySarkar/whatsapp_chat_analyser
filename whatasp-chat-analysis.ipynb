      "19/09/23, 00:48 - +91 97116 69333: Anomaly detection can be used as it is robust in scenarios where the minority class is not just small but also not well-defined. Because it doesn't try to model the minority class directly as it is trained on the majority class only. And once trained, the model is subjected to new, unseen transactions. For each transaction, the model will give a score indicating how \"anomalous\" this transaction is compared to the \"normal\" ones it was trained on. Therefore, it can sometimes catch unusual types of anomalies that a direct classification approach might miss. Treat the problem as an anomaly (or outlier) detection problem rather than a classification problem. For anamoly detection , u can use techniques like IsolationForest or OneClassSVM e.t.c. However, you have to be cautious of the fact  while using a validation set to adjust the threshold, because here the aim is to catch as many frauds as possible while minimizing false alerts. Well, this is my opinion.\n",
      "19/09/23, 00:53 - +91 98445 06080: To add to this, isolation forest identifies the anomalies based on the length of the path of completely splitting the datapoint till you get the desired target value.\n",
      "For outliers, the path length will be shorter as the splitting reaches to target value very fast.\n",
      "So the shorter path in the isolation tree will be considered as anomalies\n",
      "19/09/23, 00:53 - +91 98445 06080: It doesn't depend on the distribution of the data\n",

      "27/09/23, 21:32 - +91 98445 06080: Is it necessary to use OHE for Linear models? Using label encoder won't give much accuracy. What's the reason\n",
      "27/09/23, 21:33 - +91 97116 69333: Well! of course, presuming that the respective columns are eligible for that\n",
      "27/09/23, 21:49 - +91 6302 837 237: if both gives similar  output so how come OHE gives better accuracy in case of regression\n",
      "27/09/23, 22:03 - +91 97116 69333: But OHE technique can lead to multicollinearity I suppose. Please share the resource which says that. In  my opinion,  it depends on the characteristics of the data and the nature of the problem.\n",

The way you have explained the contents which appears to be very difficult for mediocre people like me, it has never been like this in any of platform. I started learning ML and Deep learning in year 2013 and attempted multiple times and droped that this subject is not for me but you changed the entire equation. When I started my computer scince engineerning journey in 1998(before that I have never seen computer in my life), at that time there was one gentle man Yashwant Kanetkar who simplied the programing langauge and concepts that created strong foundation to learn computer science. After him, You are the one who helped to setup foundation for AI. There is lots of contents for intelligent people and they can study from any where and this content may not be relevant also for them but for  mediocre people like me it makes lots of difference.

      "\n",
      "Imagine you have two separate Python projects: Project A and Project B. Project A requires a specific version of a library called \"requests\" (let's say version 2.20.1), while Project B requires a different version of \"requests\" (let's say version 2.25.1). To manage these dependencies, you would create two virtual environments, one for each project, using a tool like virtualenv.\n",

      "For Project A:\n",
      "\n",
      "Create a virtual environment for Project A: virtualenv projectA_env\n",

      "Activate the virtual environment: source projectB_env/bin/activate\n",

      "This way, Project A and Project B have isolated environments with their specific dependencies.\n",

      "\n",
      "Let's break down the issue and understand why this matters:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",

      "    if ((x % i == 0) and (y % i == 0)):\n",
      "        gcd = i\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In this loop, we iterate through the range of numbers from 1 to `small + 1`. For each value of `i`, if both `x` and `y` are divisible by `i`, we update the `gcd` variable to the current value of `i`. This means that `gcd` gets overwritten every time a common divisor is found. As a result, when the loop finishes, `gcd` will contain the last common divisor found, but not necessarily the greatest common divisor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider this example with `x = 60` and `y = 48`:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. When `i = 1`, `60 % 1 == 0` and `48 % 1 == 0`, so `gcd` is set to 1.\n",
      "2. When `i = 2`, `60 % 2 == 0` and `48 % 2 == 0`, so `gcd` is set to 2.\n",
      "3. This continues until `i = 12`, where `60 % 12 == 0` and `48 % 12 == 0`, so `gcd` is set to 12.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the loop, `gcd` is 12, which is the last common divisor found, but it is not the greatest common divisor. The greatest common divisor is actually 12, but the variable `gcd` did not \"remember\" the previous values because it got overwritten in each iteration of the loop.\n",
      "\n",
      "To fix this issue, we initialize `gcd` before the loop:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "gcd = 1  # Initialize gcd before the loop\n",
      "for i in range(1, small + 1):\n",

      "23/11/23, 13:12 - +91 6302 837 237: here you are not forgetting any information ,you are keeping entire encoder sequence so chance of vanishing gradient problem\n",
      "23/11/23, 13:13 - +91 6360 513 607: That's the point you using lstm internally so it solves the vanishing gradient problem that's what lstm was bought over rnn .Rnn forgets bcs of vanishing gradient when i say forget I mean you cannot the retain the memory of your initial first few words but lstm literally solved that so how come here it's not\n",

      "23/11/23, 13:47 - +91 6302 837 237: no,even we are not sure whether it will be able to remember all the information from starting to end of the sentence also context vector might not be able to hold entire information\n",
      "23/11/23, 13:48 - +91 6302 837 237: take 100 words sentence ,lstm drops something in between and context vector also might not be able to store everything\n",

      "23/11/23, 14:10 - +91 6302 837 237: i mean for machine translation task you need to hold entire data\n",
      "23/11/23, 14:11 - +91 6360 513 607: Ok so let's say lstm keeps the relevant info which is enough to give the accurate representation  i.e the output but the context vector is not able to keep or hold all the information lstm is able to hold or keep in this case the relevant information.\n",
      "Am i correct in understanding\n",
      "23/11/23, 14:13 - +91 6302 837 237: lstm doesnt carry info for longer sequence taks\n",
      "23/11/23, 14:13 - +91 6360 513 607: Or atleast the relievent  information\n",
      "23/11/23, 14:13 - +91 6302 837 237: 2nd compressing whole data in single context vector also issue\n",
      "23/11/23, 14:13 - +91 6302 837 237: for machine translation you need entire data\n",
      "23/11/23, 14:14 - +91 6360 513 607: So your saying even the irreverent data is also an important factor in machine translation.\n",
      "23/11/23, 14:14 - +91 6302 837 237: yes,nothing is irrelavent in machine translation,how come encoder decides what is relavant\n",
      "23/11/23, 14:15 - +91 6302 837 237: its decoders job\n",
      "23/11/23, 14:18 - +91 6360 513 607: Ok so lstm does solve vanishing gradient problem but it keeps the relevant information but relevant information is not enough for machine translation you also need the irrelevant information for machine learning translation so you the irrelevant information is lost by lstm and that's level1 and then the context vector cannot hold all the relievent information that is  passed by lstm output and that's another level  i.e level2 of information losss\n",
      "So in total 2 levels of information is lost\n",
      "23/11/23, 14:18 - +91 6360 513 607: Am i correct in understanding your explanation\n",
      "23/11/23, 14:19 - +91 6360 513 607: So first irrelevant information is filtered (here filters equals to information lost) \n",
      "And then with in the relevant information again some information is is filtered i.e lost in context vector <This message was edited>\n",
      "23/11/23, 14:20 - +91 6360 513 607: Bcs there is only so much content vector can store\n",
      "23/11/23, 14:21 - +91 6360 513 607: Also last thing lstm doesn't completely solves vanishing gradient it minimise this problem by keeping the relievent information and losing the irrelevant information\n",

And try incorporate mlflow into your workflow for expirement tracking...

For instance, if your ml model is giving you an mae of say 4000 then your model will be wrong in predicting the target (say 50000) with an average error of 4000.

      "13/02/24, 00:48 - +91 6360 513 607: Can you give me or explain me with a simple example\n",
      "13/02/24, 01:30 - +91 96575 63486: In probability mass function, the values for which you have probabilities are discrete. Let's assume like roll of a dice. Each face has a certain probability. Another example might be probability mass function for sum of faces of two die rolls. The values will be ranging from 2 to 12, each having some probability.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Density function is where you have infinite values. So, technically each value has zero probability. It's defined by a CONTINUOUS function. So, there are infinite possibilities. \n",
      "\n",
      "To give an analogy, assume a cubic beaker filled with water. If I tell you that one kf the vertices of the beaker is the origin (0,0,0) then would you be able to tell the volume of water at a specific point (p,q,r) ? No, right ? You can't have volume of a single point and yet when you add those infinite points, you still get a beaker full of water.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Another example: let's take a density function of height of general population. If I tell you to create a distribution by measuring the heights of all people in centimetres, you would be able to do it. But, people don't directly grow multiple centimetre(s) at a time, right ? They may grow a few millimetres or nanometers depending on time interval in which you measure them. But, you could always measure it with more accuracy (going upto Plank's length). The signifcant digits are infinite.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if I were to give you a PDF for the height of people and ask you the probability of someone having height of 6 feet, what value would you use ? 6 feet or 6.0 feet or 6.000 feet ? Would 6.00001 feet and 6.000000005 feet be  the same ? Just like the water example, you can't have probability at a specific point, because it will always be zero. But, you can calculate it for a interval.\n",
      "13/02/24, 01:34 - +91 96575 63486: So, in PDF if you want to deliberately calculate the probability of a certain value, you would need to ask the required accuracy/significant digits first. \n",
      "So, if someone said, what is the probability that a person has the height of 168 cm upto 2 decimals, you would split calculate the probability as from 167.005 to 168.005 cm. Because to the person asking, anything beyond 2 decimals doesn't matter. So, for uniformity, we divide 0.01 by 2 and take the interval as (value - 0.01/2, value + 0.01/2)\n",

      "16/02/24, 15:15 - +91 99538 80577: I am doing a stock close price inference model using regression analysis, We have a small dataset of 1 year for each day of a particular stock having columns open , high , low , volume , adjclose , close . So the data is mostly linear and normally distributed except for volume column . We ploted a heatmap for these columns and found that their value is near 1 and adj close has exactly 1 correlation so we had to remove this To remove multicollinearity we took a mean of open high low col and removed these col and were left with the mean in the data along with volume now for generalising it i made a 10 lag column for checking last 10 days mean for each day but when i am calculating vif for all these there vif is very high because the stock price is varying between 1 and 2 value so now i am having two option that\n",
      "1. either i drop all these lag column and our input col be like mean and volume and output is close\n",
      "2. go with all these but vif is high \n",

      "Data distributions are foundational concepts in statistics and data analysis, providing powerful insights that guide decision-making across industries. They help us understand variability, identify patterns, and predict future events. Here's a brief overview of some critical data distributions:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "1Ô∏è‚É£ Normal Distribution (Gaussian): Often referred to as the 'bell curve,' it is characterized by its symmetrical shape where most observations cluster around the mean. Uses? It's everywhere - psychology tests scoring (IQ), quality control processes, and error distribution in measurements.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2Ô∏è‚É£ Uniform Distribution: Every outcome has an equal chance of occurring within a range ‚Äì think rolling a fair die or random draws from a box of fixed numbers. Use cases include simulations modeling equi-probable events such as lottery systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3Ô∏è‚É£ Binomial Distribution: Models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials with two possible outcomes ('success' or 'failure'). You'll see this one when analyzing conversion rates for A/B testing or reliability assessments where there's either function or failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "4Ô∏è‚É£ Poisson Distribution: Think discrete occurrences over continuous intervals‚Äîlike customers arriving per hour at a store, network traffic hits on websites, insurance claim frequencies etc., ideal for businesses planning resources against demand fluctuations!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "5Ô∏è‚É£ Exponential Distribution: Describes time between successive rare/random events‚Äîthe half-life phenomena observed in radioactive decay is classic but also models customer service call times helping optimize staffing needs relentlessly!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "6Ô∏è‚É£ Skewed Distributions(Positive/Negative skew): When data trails off to one side; implies outliers can influence averages heavily‚Äîreal estate prices often display positive skewness due to luxury listings which alter market value perceptions significantly!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "7Ô∏è‚É£ Bimodal Distributions: Presence if twin peaks suggests mixture/overlapping distinct sub-populations‚Äîa marketer spots consumption pattern variances offering tailored strategies adapting towards diverse consumer segments efficiently!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "8Ô∏è‚É£ Log-Normal Distributions: Data never negative sometimes multiplies instead adding up exhibiting log-normality‚Äîit applies widely pharmacokinetics evaluating drug absorption/metabolism rates healthcare sectors predominantly!\n",

       " '+91 97116 69333: Anomaly detection can be used as it is robust in scenarios where the minority class is not just small but also not well-defined. Because it doesn\\'t try to model the minority class directly as it is trained on the majority class only. And once trained, the model is subjected to new, unseen transactions. For each transaction, the model will give a score indicating how \"anomalous\" this transaction is compared to the \"normal\" ones it was trained on. Therefore, it can sometimes catch unusual types of anomalies that a direct classification approach might miss. Treat the problem as an anomaly (or outlier) detection problem rather than a classification problem. For anamoly detection , u can use techniques like IsolationForest or OneClassSVM e.t.c. However, you have to be cautious of the fact  while using a validation set to adjust the threshold, because here the aim is to catch as many frauds as possible while minimizing false alerts. Well, this is my opinion.\\n',\n",
